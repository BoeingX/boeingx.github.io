This branch hosts the source code for the my personal page [https://boeingx.github.io](https://boeingx.github.io).

## Workflow

This blog is a static website proudly generated by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).
It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Due to the Github Page's [limitation on User Page](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/),
this site can only be published from the [master branch](https://github.com/BoeingX/boeingx.github.io/tree/master).
Therefore, the develop branch is chosed as the default working branch to version the source code.
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is configured to watch the develop branch,
render the contents and (force) push the site to the master branch thanks to the [pages provider](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/).

Comparing to the [official tutorial](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/github-pages-tutorial.html), the manual intervention is furthermore minimized. 
We can thus focus on writing posts and commit them as in any normal projects:
the CI takes care of everything else :blush:.
