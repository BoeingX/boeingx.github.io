<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
Hi! I am a full-time Data Scientist working mostly on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Beside <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python 3</a>,
which I used heavily in my daily work,
I am also a great fun of functional programming.
When I am free, I write most of the time <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> code.
