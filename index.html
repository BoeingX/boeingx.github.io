Hi! My name is Baoyang SONG.
I was born in China,
and spent most of my youth in the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan">Jinan</a>.

Currently I live in Paris
and work as a Data Scientist focusing on
Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Before that,
I graduated from two of leading French engineer institutions: <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole Polytechnique</a>
and <a href="https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/">T√©l√©com ParisTech</a>.
I also hold a master degree in machine learning
from <a href="http://ens-paris-saclay.fr/">Ecole normale sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay</a>.
</p>

<p>
Outside work,
my interests resolve mostly around functional programming,
and in particular
the <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
programming language. 
</p>

<p>
Apart from that, I love baking ü•ñ and pastry üç™.
